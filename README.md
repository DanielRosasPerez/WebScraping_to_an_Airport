# WebScraping_to_an_Airport
Hi, In this repo I have done web scraping to an AIRPORT page.  

The data obtained is at **airport_data.json/.xlsx**.  

The link where I've retrieved the data is:  
https://www.flightstats.com/v2/flight-tracker/departures/MEX/?year=2021&month=2&date=6&hour=0  

**PLEASE, CHANGE THE FOLLOWING DATA IN THE URL IN ORDER TO SEE WHAT THIS SITE IS ABOUT CORRECTLY:**  

***month=<current_month_as_number>***  
***date=<current_day_as_number>***  

**ONCE YOU CHANGE THAT, YOU SHOULD SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS:**
